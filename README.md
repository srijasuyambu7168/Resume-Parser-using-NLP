# Resume Parser Project README

The Resume Parser Project addresses the challenge of managing and analyzing large volumes of resumes in todayâ€™s competitive job market. By leveraging advanced NLP methodologies, the system accurately extracts and categorizes essential information such as contact details, work experience, skills, education, and certifications from resumes. The project also aims to integrate seamlessly with existing applicant tracking systems (ATS) to enhance the recruitment process.


## Proposed System

The proposed system is designed to revolutionize resume parsing and management. Key features include:

- **User Interface:** A web-based application with a user-friendly interface for resume upload and analysis.
- **Resume Parsing:** Automated extraction of details from resumes in formats like PDF and Word using advanced NLP techniques.
- **Database Management:** Integration with a MySQL database for storing and retrieving parsed data.
- **Recruitment Tools:** Features like keyword-based searching, customized filtering, and ranking algorithms to streamline candidate evaluation.

## Framework and Design

The system utilizes a combination of frontend and backend technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. 

- **Frontend:** Built with Streamlit for intuitive resume upload and analysis.
- **Backend:** Python-based, with libraries for PDF parsing (PyPDF3), NLP (pyresparser), and database interactions (pymysql).
- **Architecture:** The application processes resumes, extracts key information, stores data, and provides actionable insights through interactive visualizations.
